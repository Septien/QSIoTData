# Quantum Safe IoT Data

This repository contains the data generated and used during the development of the work [1]. The repository is organized as follows:
 - On folder CPUPerformance we have the data on execution for the different KEMs. It contains data on milliseconds and number of cycles. The file timeCPUPerformance.csv contains all the time data in a single file.
 - memoryPerformance contains the data for memory usage.
 - packetPerformance contains the data about the usage of the radio, in terms of number of packets, packets' size, and connection duration. It contains as well the data generated by the command tshark.
 - statistics contain a summary of the different variables: mean, maximum, standard deviation.

The data is separated by KEM. The RPI suffix means the data was generated on the Raspberry Pi 3B+.
